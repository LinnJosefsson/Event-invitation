Our goal is to create an event invitation in digital and physical form for a company - the event is NOT real and is only for this assignment. I've been tasked to create an event invitation landing page in <b>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</b> based of designs and sketches given to me by my group member.  <br><br> We have picked a GAMING-party Event for a company that creates their own gaming/cosplay cons. This specific event is to launch in april 2021 that will be gaming oriantated and have a lot tournaments in games, cosplays and will end the weekend with a big party; both in-game and in-real-life. This is fake by the way.",
